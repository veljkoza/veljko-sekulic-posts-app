# 💻 React Posts Assignment

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Posts Assignment ! This application is a feature-rich platform for displaying posts and associated comments, designed with performance and scalability in mind. 🚀

## Features

- **Data Fetching Library**: Created a custom library inspired by my open source npm package [react-query-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query-factory) for efficient data fetching. 🛠️
- **Client-Side Caching**: Implemented custom caching to minimize network requests and enhance user experience. 💾
- **Virtualized Posts List**: Virtualization techniques used for rendering posts list to handle large datasets without pagination. 📜
- **Lazy Loading**: Comments and users are loaded on-demand, ensuring resource optimization. 📦
- **Dependency Injection**: `HttpClient` abstracted through context for easy mock substitution during testing. 🔄
- **Modular Architecture**: Developed with a focus on modular design to facilitate maintainability and scalability. 🧩

## Getting Started

To get the application running:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone [repository-link]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:5173/` to view the app.

Wait, but you haven't copied the `.env.example` to `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

In real world we wouldn't use actual values here, but since `API_URL` is public we shouldn't worry.

## Architecture

The application is structured with a focus on modularity and separation of concerns:

- `src/app/features`: Contains the core features of the application, like post details and feed.
- `src/app/providers`: Includes context providers such as cache and HTTP client.
- `src/services`: Houses the core utilities and services for data fetching.
- `src/services`: Houses the HTTP client.
- `src/models`: Defines the data models used across the application.
- `src/ui`: Contains presentational components which are fully decoupled from rest of the codebase.


In ideal world, we would build application inside of monorepo or similar. Our application would serve for presentation purposes only, while business logic would be separated into separate packages like `models`, `services`, `infrastructure`, etc. That way we could have core logic decoupled from UI, even React.
